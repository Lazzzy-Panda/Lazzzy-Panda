 - 👋 Hi, I’m @Lazzzy-Panda
- 👀 I’m changing careers from Technical Parts Authoring to Software (particularly interesting in Python and Full-Stack)
- 🌱 following my interests, I’m currently learning Python and Web-development (Front and Back)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that challenge me and my knowledge. I would be glad for any collaboration cause 
     that will help me get a job in software
- 📫 You can reach me through GitHub itself. I still haven't figured out anonymous email option. Once I find it, I will update it here. 

- Looking forward for collaborations. : )
